# python_AB_testing_Marketing_Campaign

## Project Background

---

Zenith Marketing Solutions recently conducted an A/B test to evaluate the effectiveness of a new advertising campaign compared to a public service announcement (PSA) approach. The control group was exposed to a PSA, while the experimental group was exposed to the new ads. The test has concluded, and the company now needs to determine whether the advertising campaign was successful and, if so, quantify the impact of the ads compared to the PSA.

As a data analyst, the task is to analyze the results of the A/B test and present findings to the Head of Strategy. The analysis should answer the following key questions:

1. Was the advertising campaign successful?
2. If the campaign was successful, how much of that success can be attributed to the ads?
3. What other relevant insights can be gleaned from the data to support decision-making?
