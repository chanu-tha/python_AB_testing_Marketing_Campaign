# Python_AB_testing_Marketing_Campaign

## Project Background


Zenith Marketing Solutions recently conducted an A/B test to evaluate the effectiveness of a new advertising campaign compared to a public service announcement (PSA) approach. The control group was exposed to a PSA, while the experimental group was exposed to the new ads. The test has concluded, and the company now needs to determine whether the advertising campaign was successful and, if so, quantify the impact of the ads compared to the PSA.

As a data analyst, the task is to analyze the results of the A/B test and present findings to the Head of Strategy. The analysis should answer the following key questions:

1. Was the advertising campaign successful?
2. If the campaign was successful, how much of that success can be attributed to the ads?
3. What other relevant insights can be gleaned from the data to support decision-making?

## Executive Summary


- **Campaign Success:** The ad campaign significantly outperformed the public service announcements (PSAs). It achieved a 1.34% conversion rate versus the PSA's 1.06%, resulting in a substantial 26.31% average increase in conversions. This demonstrates the ad campaign's strong effectiveness.
- **Projected Revenue with a Caveat:** The campaign is projected to boost revenue by a promising 12% to 39%. However, it's worth noting that the overall impact on conversion behavior, while positive, is statistically considered small. A cost-benefit analysis is crucial to confirm its practical value.
- **Key Insights for Optimization:** To maximize campaign effectiveness, leverage two key findings. Users are most receptive to converting at the start of the week (Monday-Wednesday). Furthermore, there's a positive correlation between ad frequency and conversions: doubling the number of ads shown can triple the conversion rate. Consequently, prioritize ad spend during the early part of the week.

## Recommendations


- Before scaling the campaign, we need to gather data on the return per conversion, the estimated cost of campaign implementation, and the projected user traffic. This analysis will enable us to accurately calculate the campaign's profitability and ensure a positive return on investment before wider deployment.
- The observed outliers, exhibiting a conversion rate seven times higher than the average, present a potentially significant opportunity. However, we must first validate the accuracy of these data points to confirm whether these conversions are genuine user actions or anomalies stemming from the data collection system. If confirmed, we can then strategically tailor campaigns to effectively engage and convert these potentially high-value users.
- We recommend strategically increasing the ad budget for Tuesday afternoons, specifically after 14:00 to capitalize on Tuesday's strong conversion potential, despite its lower ad exposure. This targeted allocation will maximize return on ad spend by leveraging the demonstrated conversion effectiveness during this period
